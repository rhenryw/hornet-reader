I saw [corollari/waspline-reader](https://github.com/corollari/waspline-reader) hadn't been updated in 6 years and didn't work on chrome, so I thought I'd update it

**NOTICE:** *This* is *a fork of `corollari/waspline-reader`, but had left the Fork network due to freedom of repo, and the restrictions of a forked repo*
